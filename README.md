# bs-uiextensions
Additional bootstrap components

### Modules

**bs-expando**

Bootstrap plugin to allow detached accordions. By detached it is meant that the elements that trigger the expando events do not have to be contained within the expando container element. Also, trigger elements can trigger any expando element; e.g. trigger1 can toggle the third expando in expando block a and trigger2 can toggle the first expando element in expando block b. 

**bs-dropdownmenu**

Bootstrap plugin that allows a second level nested menu. The submenu can be statically open or can toggle with animation.
